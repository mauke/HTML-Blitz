    - allow <math/> and <svg/> (i.e. math and svg elements can be self-closing)
    - treat param as void in the parser
    - treat basefont, bgsound, frage, keygen, parser as void in HTML::Blitz::Builder

    - fatalize 'uninitialized' warnings; i.e. templates will now die() if they
      encounter undefined variables
    - treat basefont, bgsound, frame, keygen as void elements; i.e. they cannot
      have content or close tags
    - special-case the contents of script, style, and title elements; they
      cannot have child elements and (in the case of style and script) they
      don't support HTML entities to escape text contents
